<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>Hey hey hey! Welcome to the offline editable release of the tutorial!</p>

<p>You can study it on Cook islands being completely out of the net, and everything would work. You can edit it and push updates which get merged in.</p>

<p>To start browsing, go to the language folder and open <code>nav.html</code>.</p>


<h2>TroubleShooting</h2>

For Chrome/Chromium: run the browser with the flag <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code>.

For other issues and suggestions, use Github at <a href="https://github.com/iliakan/javascript-book/">https://github.com/iliakan/javascript-book/</a>.

<h2>Contribution</h2>

You are welcome to:
<ul>
<li>Fix typos.</li>
<li>Translate the book.</li>
<li>Rephrase and improve the text, make it better.</li>
<li>Change styles, improve look and feel.</li>
<li>Add your chapters.</li>

<p>The contributions are carefully reviewed and appended or integrated with the current content.</p>

<p>All changes are done offline. This way is chosen, because it gives full freedom.</p>
You can add images, HTML/JS/CSS examples and manage the text in your favorite editor.

<p>The formatting of the text is HTML-compatible, with many features borrowed from Markdown and additional, powerful abilities for interactive JS and HTML/CSS. Read about it in <a href="about/format.html">about/format.html</a>.</p>


<h3>Sending changes</h3>

<p>First, if you contribute something new, like translation or a new chapter, you can just send it in the way you like. See the email below.</p>

<p>If you know Git, then create a pull request for <a href="https://github.com/iliakan/javascript-book/">https://github.com/iliakan/javascript-book/</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't know Git... Things are still easy. You can install and use it in 5 mins.</p>

<ol>
<li>Grab it from <a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a>, install.</li>
<li>Run <code>git clone git://github.com/iliakan/javascript-book.git jsbook</code>, that creates <code>jsbook</code> folder with the book.</li>
<li>Edit the book in that folder.</li>
<li>To summarize changes, run <code>git diff &gt;my.diff</code> in the folder. It saves all changes in the file <code>my.diff</code>.</li>
<li>Send it on the email <a href="mailto:iliakan@javascript.info">iliakan@javascript.info</a>. Now they will get merged in. </li>
</ol>

<p>Actually, Git is much more powerful than that. But there are more thorough books and manuals about it ;).</p>
